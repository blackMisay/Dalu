# Dalu
this tool automates the process of building data pipelines. It takes in data from different sources, transform it, and then load it into a database or data warehouse. The data sources could be CSV files, JSON data, or data from APIs.

Dalu main function consist of the following:

- **Input**: The user provides the source of the data (CSV, JSON, API) and the destination (database or data warehouse).
- **Extract**: The tool extracts data from the specified source and loads it into memory.
- **Transform**: The tool applies transformations to the data. These transformations could include filtering data, joining data, or applying calculations.
- **Load**: The tool loads the transformed data into the specified destination.
- **Logging**: The tool logs the entire process, including any errors or warnings.

It is built using Python and various libraries, such as Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and Apache Airflow. Some APIs, such as the Twitter API or the Google Sheets API, to extract data from different sources.

This project could be expanded to include more features, such as scheduling, error handling, and data validation. It could also be customized to work with different data sources and destinations.
